# Birthday Music Note

Since I cannot download copyrighted music, you'll need to add your own birthday music file.

## How to Add Music:

1. **Find a Happy Birthday song**:
   - Use royalty-free music from sites like:
     - [Pixabay Music](https://pixabay.com/music/)
     - [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/)
     - [YouTube Audio Library](https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music)
   - Search for "happy birthday instrumental" or "birthday celebration music"

2. **Download the MP3 file**

3. **Add to project**:
   ```bash
   # Copy your music file to the public folder
   # Rename it to: birthday-music.mp3
   ```
   Place it at: `c:\Users\suir\Desktop\New folder (2)\birthday-wishes\public\birthday-music.mp3`

4. **Alternative**: Create a silent audio file for testing:
   - The app will work without music, the toggle just won't play anything

The music toggle button is already implemented in the top-right corner of the page!
